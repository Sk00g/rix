stateManager.pop()

ORIGIN_SELECTION -> TARGET_SELECTION



OVERARCHING APP STATES:

LOGIN -> LOBBY -> GAMEPLAY 
            -> STATSVIEW
            -> CREATE GAME



GAMEPLAY STATES:

VIEW_ONLY -> REPLAY_TURN -> DEPLOY -> ORDER

ORDER STATES:
    -> PRE_SELECT 
        * hover action on region if has more than one unit
        * can select a region for a new order, or an existing order
    -> ORDER_EDIT (can't end order phase from this state)
        * on init -> highlight the order so it's clear it's selected
        * arrows from gray to green
        * put up amount GUI [X][M] -1 +1 +5 [Y]
        * while in this state, can select a new region to target
        * state can be easily cancelled by clicks / hotkeys
        * place holder for an order is pathway of gray areas, 50% faded / smaller? avatar with num?
    -> TARGET_SELECT
        * when you select a valid region
        * strong fading on all regions that are no longer clickable
        * fairly strong highlighting of selected region, walking unit, grow 0.25
        * highlight viable targets with slightly different hover based on ally / enemy
        * when region is selected -> ORDER_EDIT
    -> CONFIRM
        * obvious message section bottom / right
        * throughout state, all orders are laid out somewhere in HUD for review (also in actual map)
        * units march out of owned region into middle ground on arrow (or occurs during ORDER_EDIT?)

DEPLOY STATES:
    -> REGION_SELECTION (hover action on region)
        * in this state, can end deployment with a button / hotkey -> CONFIRM
    -> EDIT_AMOUNT 
        * select graphics on region, edit numbers UI [X][M] -1 +1 +5 [Y]
        * faded counter beside actual counter with current value
        * deselect by other region or explicit ENTER or check ([Y])
            -> on deselect, do the walk-in fade thing animation, stay 75%
        * buttons graying out when you can't*
        * HUD includes side bar with little army dudes that disappear as you deploy*
    -> CONFIRM 
        * optional confirmation, very obvious message section bottom / right
        * exits deploy into ORDER state
        * run final animation with opaqueness, number glow, etc.

General Notes:
    - player own units are bright and others dimmed in DEPLOY or ORDER states


#TODO
* make conductor class to handle animation sequences
* make core game object class Region (switch current Region to RegionVisual)????
* make class for order, ORDER game state creates a list of these
